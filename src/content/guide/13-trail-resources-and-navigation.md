# Trail Resources & Navigation


## Primary Guidebook Reference

### A.T. Guide (The Standard AT Guide)

The primary guidebook most Appalachian Trail thru-hikers use and carry is the **A.T. Guide** (formerly known as AWOL's Appalachian Trail Guide). When hikers on the trail refer to "the guide" or "the book," this is almost always what they mean.

This guide is instantly recognizable by its long, narrow, spiral-bound format, a shape intentionally designed for backpack use. Many hikers tear out completed sections as they progress northbound, while others keep the full book intact. A large number of hikers now carry the electronic version instead of the physical book.

### Why the A.T. Guide Is the Gold Standard

The A.T. Guide is considered the most complete single reference for the AT because it combines essential planning and navigation information into one resource:

- Strip maps showing the trail mile by mile
- Elevation profiles that clearly display upcoming climbs and descents
- Shelter locations and distances between shelters
- Designated campsites and tenting areas
- Reliable and seasonal water sources
- Road crossings and trailheads
- Trail towns, hostels, and resupply access
- Northbound and southbound mileage listings

This makes the guide ideal for:
- Daily mileage planning
- Camp and shelter decisions
- Anticipating difficult climbs before reaching them
- Overall trail logistics from Georgia to Maine

### Latest Physical Edition

**A.T. Guide 2026 (Spiral-Bound)**

- Covers the entire Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mount Katahdin, Maine
- Updated annually
- The most common physical guide seen on trail
- Formerly known as "AWOL's Guide"

### Electronic / Digital Versions

Many thru-hikers now choose the digital version rather than carrying the paper book.

**A.T. Guide Digital Edition (PDF / Kindle)**

- Same maps, data, and content as the paper guide
- Zoomable maps and elevation profiles
- Works offline once downloaded
- No added pack weight

### How Most Thru-Hikers Actually Use It on Trail

Most experienced Appalachian Trail hikers rely on a tool combination, not just one resource:

- **A.T. Guide** — Primary reference for mileage, elevation, shelters, and camp planning
- **FarOut App** — Used for real-time comments, current water reliability, trail closures, and on-the-ground updates
- **AT Data Book (optional)** — Lightweight backup reference

*The A.T. Guide provides structure and predictability. FarOut provides live, crowdsourced intelligence.*

### Practical Recommendation

For an efficient, modern thru-hike setup:

- Use the A.T. Guide (digital PDF or Kindle) as your primary planning reference
- Pair it with FarOut for up-to-date trail conditions
- Carrying the paper guide is optional and mainly for redundancy or personal preference

*If electronics fail, the paper A.T. Guide becomes invaluable. If conditions change rapidly, FarOut fills the gaps.*

## Typical Carry Strategy

### Standard Food Carry Range

**3 to 5 days of food**

This is the dominant norm across the entire trail.

### By Section

**Early Trail (Georgia through Southern NC)**
- Common carry: 3-4 days
- Frequent road crossings, hostels close together

**Mid-Trail and Later**
- Common carry: 4-5 days
- Rhythm stabilizes

### Long Carries (6-7+ Days)

Exceptions only. Primarily the 100-Mile Wilderness in Maine.

## Known Detours (2025-2026)

| Detour | Distance | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Nolichucky River Bridge Detour (TN) | ~3.6 mi | Active (Hurricane Helene damage) |
| Iron Mountain Gap Detour (NC/TN) | ~6 mi | Active (debris removal near Cherry Gap Shelter) |
| Virginia Creeper Trail Closure (Damascus area) | ~20.9 mi | Active through ~fall 2026 (Hurricane Helene destroyed 30+ trestles) |
