# Weather Strategy

## Temperature Planning

### Elevation Temperature Drop

**Worst-case planning:** 5.5°F colder per 1,000 feet of elevation gain

This represents dry air, strong mixing, and cold-biased conditions.

### Example: Hot Springs to Max Patch

- Hot Springs: ~1,300 ft
- Max Patch summit: ~4,629 ft
- Elevation gain: ~3,329 ft

**If 30°F in Hot Springs:**
- 1,000 ft up: 24.5°F
- 2,000 ft up: 19.0°F
- Max Patch: ~12°F (before wind chill)

### Wind Chill Impact

At 12°F air temperature:
| Wind Speed | Feels Like |
|------------|------------|
| 5 mph | ~4°F |
| 10 mph | ~-1°F |
| 15 mph | ~-4°F |
| 20 mph | ~-6°F |

### Field-Use Mental Shortcut

When you're hiking and checking a town forecast:

1. Subtract 5-6°F per 1,000 ft
2. Add wind penalty:
   - +5 mph ≈ feels 4-6°F colder
   - +10 mph ≈ feels 8-12°F colder
   - +20 mph ≈ feels 15-25°F colder
3. If it's a bald, assume wind exists

### Bottom Line (Planning Truth)

If you plan for this document's numbers:
- You will never be underdressed
- You will never be surprised
- You will always have margin

## Heat Timeline & Strategy

**Start Date:** February 1
**Direction:** Northbound (NOBO)
**Daily Pace:** 8-10 miles per hiking day
**Realistic Calendar Pace:** ~7-8 trail miles/day including zero/nero days

### When Heat STARTS to Matter

**Heat Onset Zone**
- Mile Markers: ~600-700
- Region: Southern to Central Virginia

**Calendar Timing (Feb 1 Start)**
- Mile 600: ~Day 80-85 → April 20-25
- Mile 700: ~Day 95-100 → May 5-10

**Conditions You'll Notice:**
- Daytime highs consistently in the 70s to low 80s
- Humidity becomes persistent
- Sweating increases dramatically
- Water and electrolyte planning becomes mandatory

### Where Heat Is WORST (Primary Heat Grind)

**Peak Heat & Humidity Zone**
- Mile Markers: ~900-1450
- Regions Covered: Central & Northern Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Southern Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York

**Calendar Timing:**
- Mile 900: ~Late May
- Mile 1200: ~Early July
- Mile 1450: ~Early August

**Typical Conditions:**
- High humidity with limited airflow
- "Green tunnel" effect trapping heat
- Hot, sticky nights
- Increased risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion

**This is the most demanding heat stretch of the entire trail.** Success here depends on discipline: early starts, consistent hydration, electrolytes, shade management, and controlled pacing.

### When Heat STARTS to Ease

**Heat Taper Zone**
- Mile Markers: ~1550-1750
- Region: Vermont into New Hampshire

**Calendar Timing:**
- Mile 1550: ~Mid-August
- Mile 1750: ~Late August

**What Improves:**
- Cooler overnight temperatures
- Fewer oppressive humidity days
- Heat stops being the primary daily stressor

### Summary Table

| Phase | Mile Markers | Approximate Dates |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Heat begins | 600-700 | April 20 - May 10 |
| Worst heat | 900-1450 | Late May - Early August |
| Heat eases | 1550-1750 | Mid - Late August |

### Strategic Takeaways

- A February 1 NOBO cannot avoid summer heat
- You encounter heat with strong legs and lower injury risk
- The worst heat is predictable and finite
- You exit oppressive heat before September

## Multi-Day Rain Strategy

### Core Principles

- Rain alone is manageable. Wind + rain is the threat.
- Your sleep system must stay dry at all costs.
- You operate in two phases: WET PHASE → DRY PHASE.
- Decisions are made early, not at dark.

### Movement Strategy

- Continue hiking in rain
- Reduce mileage slightly if needed
- Take short, infrequent breaks
- Stay warm by movement, not by stopping

### Rain Camp Sequence

**Step 1: Pitch tent FIRST (wet phase)**
Pitch immediately on arrival. Do NOT open dry bags.

**Step 2: Cook & Eat (wet phase)**
Cook outside or at vestibule edge. Rain gear stays ON.

**Step 3: Bear Hang IMMEDIATELY (wet phase)**
Do not enter tent before this step.

**Step 4: Dry Phase Transition (inside tent)**
- Enter tent, close door
- Strip wet clothes
- Put on dry sleep clothes
- Get into quilt

**If you forgot something outside — it waits.**

## Off-Grid Weather Awareness

Using Apple Watch Ultra + Garmin inReach Mini 2 without internet.

### Core Principle

**You NEVER evaluate pressure while hiking. You ONLY evaluate pressure while STOPPED.**

Trail elevation changes while hiking are meaningless for weather detection. Elevation drift while stationary = pressure change.

### Morning Baseline (5 minutes)

- Open Apple Watch → Compass → Elevation
- Stand still 2-3 minutes
- Note the elevation number
- Pull Garmin weather forecast

### How to Interpret Elevation Drift (While Still)

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Elevation fluctuates ±3-5 ft, settles quickly | Normal/Stable — Pressure stable, weather stable |
| Elevation drops 10-20 ft over 3-6 hours without moving | Caution — Weather likely in 12-24 hours |
| Elevation drops 20-30+ ft in 1-3 hours | Danger — Weather imminent, adjust plans immediately |

### The 2-Out-of-5 Rule

**If ANY TWO occur together, act conservatively:**

1. Pressure dropping (Ultra elevation drift)
2. Wind increasing or shifting
3. Clouds thickening or lowering
4. Garmin forecast worsens
5. Sudden temperature drop
