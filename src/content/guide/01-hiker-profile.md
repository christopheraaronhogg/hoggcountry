# Hiker Profile & Experience

## Hiking Resume

This section documents verified long-distance completions, prior AT experience, and the skills that directly translate to Appalachian Trail readiness.

### Completed Thru-Hikes

| Trail | Distance | Elevation Gain | Location |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Ouachita Trail | ~223 miles | ~45,000 ft | Arkansas-Oklahoma |
| Ozark Highlands Trail | ~270 miles | ~35,000-40,000 ft | Northern Arkansas |
| Ozark Trail | ~230 miles | ~40,000 ft | Missouri |

**Total Completed Mileage:** ~720+ miles  
**Estimated Cumulative Elevation Gain:** ~120,000+ feet

### Recognition

**Sassafras Award — Ozark Society**  
Awarded for completion of the Ouachita Trail, Ozark Highlands Trail, and Ozark Trail. *6th person in history to receive this award.*

### Prior Appalachian Trail Experience

- **Standing Bear Farm to Hot Springs, NC** — ~35 miles | ~9,000 ft elevation gain | Full pack, winter conditions
- **Newfound Gap to Kuwohi (Overnight)** — ~16 miles round trip | ~3,300 ft elevation gain | Shelter stay in ~17°F conditions | Summit: 6,643 ft (highest point on the AT)

*Note: Clingmans Dome was officially renamed to "Kuwohi" in 2024, restoring its Cherokee name meaning "mulberry place."*

### High-Elevation Experience (Comparison Benchmark)

**Pikes Peak, Colorado — Crags Trail**  
~13 miles round trip | ~4,300 ft elevation gain | Summit elevation: 14,115 ft

*Note: Pikes Peak is located in Colorado, not on the Appalachian Trail. This entry is included as a cardiovascular and altitude benchmark demonstrating capability for AT climbs.*

### Core Competencies

- Multi-week self-supported backpacking
- Cold-weather camping and shelter living
- Sustained elevation gain/loss over long distances
- Rugged, rocky, under-maintained trail systems
- River crossings and navigation
- Resupply planning and execution
- Proven physical and mental endurance

## Mountain Climb Readiness & Assessment

### Ranked Difficulty (Reality-Based)

**TIER 1 — LEGENDARY**
- Mount Washington
- Mount Katahdin
- The Priest

**TIER 2 — MAJOR GRINDERS**
- Snowbird Mountain
- Cheoah Bald
- Mount Moosilauke
- Franconia Ridge

**TIER 3 — HARD BUT MANAGEABLE**
- Blood Mountain
- Kuwohi (Clingmans Dome)
- Bigelow Range

### Experience Benchmark: Pikes Peak (Colorado)

**Crags Trail → Summit**
- Start elevation: ~10,000 ft
- Summit: 14,115 ft
- Net gain: ~4,100 ft
- Distance: ~6.5 miles

**What This Proves:**
- You've already matched Katahdin-level vertical
- You started higher than any AT climb
- Cardiovascularly, the AT holds no surprises

*Note: This benchmark is for fitness comparison only—Pikes Peak is not on the Appalachian Trail.*

## Weather & Elevation Rules

### Temperature Rule

**Temperature Lapse Rates by Condition:**
- **Standard (dry air):** -3.5°F per 1,000 ft gained
- **Moist air:** -3.3°F per 1,000 ft gained
- **Worst-case (dry, windy):** -5.5°F per 1,000 ft gained

*Use worst-case for safety planning on exposed ridges and balds.*

### Wind Chill Guidelines

| Wind Speed | Feels Like |
|------------|------------|
| 10 mph | ~9°F colder |
| 20 mph | ~15°F colder |
| 30 mph | ~19°F colder |
| 40+ mph | ~22°F+ colder |

### Hard Bail Conditions

- Wind >30 mph above treeline
- Ice on rock
- Freezing rain
- Visibility <100 ft
- Rapid temperature drop (>15°F/hour)

### Month-by-Month Risk Overview (NOBO)

| Month | Region | Conditions | Risk Level |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| February | GA → Southern NC | Cold, ice risk, short daylight | Moderate-High |
| March | Smokies | High elevation, severe wind chill | High |
| April | NC → VA | Wet, improving temps | Moderate |
| May | Central VA | Heat + steep climbs | Moderate |
| June | Shenandoahs → PA | Rocks, fatigue | Low-Moderate |
| July | NY → VT | Heat, storms, mud | Moderate |
| August | Whites (NH) | Exposure, extreme weather | Very High |
| September | Maine | Cold, wet rock, fatigue | High |

## Readiness Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Physical Readiness | 9/10 | Long climbs proven, cold conditions proven |
| Mental Readiness | 10/10 | You've already hiked when it sucked, you know when to back off |
| Logistics Readiness | 8.5/10 | Trail rhythm still develops on-trail |
| **OVERALL NOBO READINESS** | **9/10** | |

### What Your 49 AT Miles Mean

- You are ahead of the average NOBO at Springer
- Georgia and NC will not shock you
- Virginia will annoy you, not break you
- Whites and Maine demand respect, not fear

*Most hikers learn these lessons in the first 200 miles. You already own them.*

### Daily GO / NO-GO Check

1. What's today's summit elevation?
2. Town temp minus (3.5°F × elevation gain in thousands)
3. Wind forecast?
4. Any exposure above treeline?

**If wind >30 mph or ice on rock: → Delay or bail**
