# Weather Strategy

## Temperature Planning

### Elevation Temperature Drop
**Worst-case planning: 5.5°F colder per 1,000 feet of elevation gain**

This represents dry air, strong mixing, and cold-biased conditions.

### Example: Hot Springs to Max Patch
- Hot Springs: ~1,378 ft
- Max Patch summit: ~4,629 ft
- Elevation gain: ~3,251 ft

If 30°F in Hot Springs:
- 1,000 ft up: 24.5°F
- 2,000 ft up: 19.0°F
- Max Patch: **~12°F** (before wind chill)

### Wind Chill Impact
At 12°F air temperature:
| Wind Speed | Feels Like |
|------------|------------|
| 5 mph | ~4°F |
| 10 mph | ~-1°F |
| 15 mph | ~-4°F |
| 20 mph | ~-6°F |

## Multi-Day Rain Strategy

### Core Principles
- Rain alone is manageable. **Wind + rain is the threat.**
- Your sleep system must stay dry at all costs.
- You operate in two phases: **WET PHASE → DRY PHASE**
- Decisions are made early, not at dark.

### Movement Strategy
- Continue hiking in rain
- Reduce mileage slightly if needed
- Take short, infrequent breaks
- Stay warm by movement, not by stopping

### Rain Camp Sequence

**Step 1: Pitch tent FIRST (wet phase)**
Pitch immediately on arrival. Do NOT open dry bags.

**Step 2: Cook & Eat (wet phase)**
Cook outside or at vestibule edge. Rain gear stays ON.

**Step 3: Bear Hang IMMEDIATELY (wet phase)**
Do not enter tent before this step.

**Step 4: Dry Phase Transition (inside tent)**
- Enter tent, close door
- Strip wet clothes
- Put on dry sleep clothes
- Get into quilt
- **If you forgot something outside — it waits.**

## Off-Grid Weather Awareness

Using Apple Watch Ultra + Garmin inReach Mini 2 without internet.

### Core Principle
> **You NEVER evaluate pressure while hiking. You ONLY evaluate pressure while STOPPED.**

Trail elevation changes while hiking are meaningless for weather detection. Elevation drift while stationary = pressure change.

### Morning Baseline (5 minutes)
1. Open Apple Watch → Compass → Elevation
2. Stand still 2-3 minutes
3. Note the elevation number
4. Pull Garmin weather forecast

### How to Interpret Elevation Drift (While Still)

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Normal/Stable** | Elevation fluctuates ±3-5 ft, settles quickly. Pressure stable, weather stable. |
| **Caution — Weather Approaching** | Elevation drops 10-20 ft over 3-6 hours without moving. Weather likely in 12-24 hours. |
| **Danger — Weather Imminent** | Elevation drops 20-30+ ft in 1-3 hours. Rapid pressure drop. **Adjust plans immediately.** |

### The 2-Out-of-5 Rule

If **ANY TWO** occur together, act conservatively:

1. Pressure dropping (Ultra elevation drift)
2. Wind increasing or shifting
3. Clouds thickening or lowering
4. Garmin forecast worsens
5. Sudden temperature drop
