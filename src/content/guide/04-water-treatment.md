# Water Treatment System

## Final System Decision

**Primary:** Hollow-fiber filter (BeFree or Platypus QuickDraw class)
**Backup:** Chlorine dioxide tablets

### Why This Combination

- Filters cannot be reliably tested after possible freezing
- Chemical drops provide guaranteed backup
- Both systems require waiting time in cold water (30-45 minutes)
- Filter + drops provides maximum margin

---

## Tablet Selection

**Potable Aqua — Chlorine Dioxide Water Purification Tablets**

- Same chemistry as Aquamira drops
- Kills bacteria, viruses, Giardia
- Kills Cryptosporidium with extended time
- Best taste among widely available tablets
- Cannot freeze

### Supply Math

- Daily water use: 3 liters
- 1 tablet = 1 liter
- 60 days = 180 tablets
- Buy 10 packs (20 tablets each) = 200 liters coverage

---

## Winter Workflow

### Step 1 — Collect
Scoop water into dirty bottle or bag. Choose clearest source available.

### Step 2 — Filter
Filter into 1L Smartwater bottle. Removes sediment, improves taste. Water is NOT virus-safe yet.

### Step 3 — Purify
Drop 1 chlorine dioxide tablet into bottle. Cap and gently shake.

### Step 4 — Wait
- Normal filtered spring water: 30-45 minutes
- Cold, questionable, high-use areas: up to 4 hours

### Step 5 — Drink
Water is now safe from bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.

## Freeze Protection Rules

### Night Rule (Non-Negotiable)

**Liquids and lithium sleep with you.**

Put these inside your sleeping bag every night:
- Filter
- Tablets
- Batteries
- Glasses
- Phone / InReach

### Day Rule

After using the filter:
- Shake out excess water
- Put filter immediately against your body
- Inner jacket pocket or fanny pack

### What Does NOT Work

- Backpack pockets
- Wrapped in clothes inside pack
- Insulated sleeves without body heat

**Insulation without heat always loses overnight.**

## Water Types — What to Use & What to Avoid

### BEST WATER (GREEN LIGHT)

- Piped springs
- Flowing springs
- Rock-fed hillside trickles
- Waterfalls
- Fast, cold creeks

*Filter or drops work well. Filter + drops is ideal.*

### ACCEPTABLE WITH CAUTION (YELLOW LIGHT)

- Clear pooled spring seeps
- Large rivers (upstream of human activity)
- Large, cold lakes (prefer inflow streams)
- Fresh, clean snow (must be melted and treated)

*Use full treatment protocol.*

### AVOID EVEN WITH TREATMENT (RED LIGHT)

- Rain puddles
- Beaver ponds
- Warm stagnant pools
- Algae-covered water
- Road or farm runoff
- Water with chemical or rotten smell

*Treatment does not make these safe.*

## Real-World Water Planning Rules

- Creeks = trust
- Springs = verify
- Seeps = ignore
- Never skip water before a ridge
- Carry extra when shelter water is spring-fed
- Ask: "What's my next guaranteed creek?"

### The 1-Liter Rule (Realistic)

**1 liter works when:**
- Sources are reliable
- Quality is high
- Temps are cool

**Break the rule intentionally when:**
- Long dry stretches
- Questionable water ahead
- High heat or exposure

*Carrying extra temporarily is smart, not failure.*

## Why Guide Water Icons Can Be Misleading

**AWOL/A.T. Guide marks water based on:**
- Historical existence
- Average-year assumptions
- Warm-season bias

**What guides do not account for:**
- Freeze
- Low-flow springs
- Drought cycles
- Ridge exposure

**FarOut is better because of:**
- Crowd-sourced updates
- Recent comments (gold standard)
- Freeze and dry reports

**How to use FarOut correctly:**
1. Ignore the icon alone
2. Read recent comments (last 7-10 days)
3. Trust creeks, verify springs
4. Always identify your next guaranteed source
