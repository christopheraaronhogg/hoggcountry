## LumaFusion Video Editing Guide

### What LumaFusion Is

LumaFusion is a professional, timeline-based video editing application originally designed for mobile creators. Despite being mobile-first, it operates much closer to desktop editors like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere than to consumer apps like iMovie, CapCut, or InShot.

It is a **true nonlinear editor**, not a template or preset editor.

LumaFusion is widely used by:
- Journalists
- Documentary filmmakers
- Travel and adventure creators
- Solo shooters
- Mobile-only production teams

### Platforms — Where It Runs

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| **iPhone** | Fully supported, complete feature set. Best suited for short to medium edits (5-10 minutes). Excellent for field editing and daily videos. |
| **iPad** | The platform LumaFusion was designed for. Best overall experience. Supports Apple Pencil, keyboards, and external drives. Many professionals use iPad-only workflows. |
| **Mac (Apple Silicon Only)** | Runs on M1, M2, M3, and M4 Macs. Uses the iPad version of the app. Performs well. Interface remains touch-optimized, not mouse-first. No native macOS-specific UI. |
| **Android / ChromeOS** | Supported as of recent versions. |
| **Windows** | Not supported. No official version. No reliable workaround. |
