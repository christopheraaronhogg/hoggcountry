# Food & Resupply

## Typical Carry Strategy

### Standard Food Carry Range

**3 to 5 days of food**

This is the dominant norm across the entire trail.

### By Section

**Early Trail (Georgia through Southern NC)**
- Common carry: 3-4 days
- Frequent road crossings, hostels close together

**Mid-Trail and Later**
- Common carry: 4-5 days
- Rhythm stabilizes

### Long Carries (6-7+ Days)

Exceptions only. Primarily the 100-Mile Wilderness in Maine.

## Trail Food Staples

### Breakfast
- Instant oatmeal packets
- Pop-Tarts
- Granola or cereal
- Carnation Breakfast Essentials

### Lunch & All-Day Carry
- Tortillas (won't crush like bread)
- Peanut butter or Nutella
- Summer sausage
- Hard cheese
- Tuna or chicken foil packets

### Dinner (One-Pot Meals)
- Instant ramen noodles
- Knorr Pasta or Rice Sides
- Instant mashed potatoes
- Couscous or instant rice

### Snacks
- Snickers (unofficial AT currency)
- M&Ms, Reese's
- Trail mix
- Jerky
- Energy bars

## Food Storage & Bear Protection

### The Three Problems

1. **Bears** — Strong, smart, food-conditioned in many AT areas
2. **Mice / Rodents** — Everywhere shelters exist. Silent. Chew gear, not just food.
3. **Humans** — Tired, lazy at night, cut corners. Cause most failures.

## PCT Bear Hang (Gold Standard)

### Required Geometry (Non-Negotiable)

- Branch height: 18-20 feet
- Bag height: ~12 feet off ground
- Distance from trunk: ~6 feet
- Distance below branch: ~6 feet

### Step-by-Step

1. Choose single strong horizontal branch
2. Throw line over branch (use throw bag)
3. Clip food bag to one end with carabiner
4. Hoist bag to proper height
5. Insert stick toggle into carabiner
6. Slowly lower rope until toggle jams
7. Let free end hang loose

**Nothing is tied to the tree.**

### Simple Decision Rule

- Bear box available? → Use it
- Bear cables or poles? → Use them
- No system + tenting/shelter? → PCT hang
- Sleeping in shelter (no bear system)? → Mouse line + odor control

## Mouse Lines (Shelter Use)

### What They Are
- Rope or wire hanging from rafters with hooks or carabiners
- Purpose: Rodents only (mice, chipmunks, squirrels)
- NOT for bears

### How to Use Correctly
- One bag per hook
- Bag hangs 12–18 inches below the line
- Bag is 12+ inches away from walls, beams, or other bags
- No loose knots or dangling loops
- Smooth-sided bag only

### Common Mouse Failures
- Bag touching wall
- Bags touching each other
- Knots and loops as ladders
- Food left out "for a minute"

## Food Bag Setup (Bag Inside a Bag)

### Why This Matters
Bears follow scent plumes. Odor reduction reduces investigation time.

### Correct Storage Stack (inside → out)

**Layer 1:** Individual food packaging  
**Layer 2:** Odor-resistant liner (all smellables together)  
**Layer 3:** Outer bear hang sack (slick, strong)  
**Layer 4:** Rope + carabiner + toggle

### What Counts as "Smellables"
- Food
- Trash
- Wrappers
- Toothpaste
- Chapstick
- Flavored drink mixes

**All of it goes inside the liner.**

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Crumbs floating free
- ❌ Trash outside liner
- ❌ Toothpaste in side pockets
- ❌ Open wrappers in the bag

*Loose = odor leaks faster.*

## Early NOBO Reality Check
- Georgia → NC: More bear attention near shelters
- Great Smoky Mountains: Cables are mandatory
- Shelters: Mice guaranteed
- Winter: Boxes may freeze, cables preferred

## Ramen Cooking Guide

### Trail/Fuel-Saving Method

1. Bring 2-2½ cups water to rolling boil
2. Turn stove OFF
3. Add noodles
4. Cover pot immediately
5. Let sit 5-7 minutes (7-8 minutes below freezing)
6. Add seasoning packet
7. Stir thoroughly
8. Eat immediately

**Key Rule:** Seasoning goes in AFTER soaking, not before.

### Peanut Butter Ramen

**Chicken broth + peanut butter does NOT taste good.**

**Best Method: Noodles + Peanut Butter Only**

1. Cook noodles using trail method
2. Drain most water
3. Add 1-2 tablespoons peanut butter
4. Stir until fully coated
5. Optional: Add pinch of seasoning for salt
