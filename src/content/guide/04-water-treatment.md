# Water Treatment System

## Final System Decision

- **Primary:** Hollow-fiber filter (BeFree or Platypus QuickDraw class)
- **Backup:** Chlorine dioxide tablets

### Why This Combination
- Filters cannot be reliably tested after possible freezing
- Chemical drops provide guaranteed backup
- Both systems require waiting time in cold water (30-45 minutes)
- Filter + drops provides maximum margin

## Tablet Selection: Potable Aqua — Chlorine Dioxide

- Same chemistry as Aquamira drops
- Kills bacteria, viruses, Giardia
- Kills Cryptosporidium with extended time
- Best taste among widely available tablets
- **Cannot freeze**

### Supply Math
- Daily water use: 3 liters
- 1 tablet = 1 liter
- 60 days = 180 tablets
- Buy 10 packs (20 tablets each) = 200 liters coverage

## Winter Workflow

### Step 1 — Collect
Scoop water into dirty bottle or bag. Choose clearest source available.

### Step 2 — Filter
Filter into 1L Smartwater bottle. Removes sediment, improves taste. **Water is NOT virus-safe yet.**

### Step 3 — Purify
Drop 1 chlorine dioxide tablet into bottle. Cap and gently shake.

### Step 4 — Wait
- Normal filtered spring water: 30-45 minutes
- Cold, questionable, high-use areas: up to 4 hours

### Step 5 — Drink
Water is now safe from bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.

## Freeze Protection Rules

### Night Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **Liquids and lithium sleep with you.**

Put these inside your sleeping bag every night:
- Filter
- Tablets
- Batteries
- Glasses
- Phone / InReach

### Day Rule
After using the filter:
- Shake out excess water
- Put filter immediately against your body
- Inner jacket pocket or fanny pack

### What Does NOT Work
- Backpack pockets
- Wrapped in clothes inside pack
- Insulated sleeves without body heat

**Insulation without heat always loses overnight.**
