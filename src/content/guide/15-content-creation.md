## LumaFusion Video Editing Guide

### What LumaFusion Is

LumaFusion is a professional, timeline-based video editing application originally designed for mobile creators. Despite being mobile-first, it operates much closer to desktop editors like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere than to consumer apps like iMovie, CapCut, or InShot.

It is a **true nonlinear editor**, not a template or preset editor.

### Platforms — Where It Runs

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| **iPhone** | Fully supported, complete feature set. Best suited for short to medium edits (5-10 minutes). Excellent for field editing and daily videos. |
| **iPad** | The platform LumaFusion was designed for. Best overall experience. Supports Apple Pencil, keyboards, and external drives. |
| **Mac (Apple Silicon Only)** | Runs on M1, M2, M3, and M4 Macs. Uses the iPad version of the app. Interface remains touch-optimized, not mouse-first. |
| **Android / ChromeOS** | Supported as of recent versions. |
| **Windows** | Not supported. No official version. |

### What LumaFusion Is Best At

LumaFusion excels at:
- Fast daily edits
- Field editing without a laptop
- Multi-track storytelling
- Voiceover and ambient sound workflows
- Travel and documentary content
- Publishing-ready exports directly from mobile devices

*It is especially strong for consistent, repeatable daily videos, such as long-distance hiking documentation.*

### Why LumaFusion Fits a Long-Distance Hiking Workflow

For a multi-month hike with daily videos, LumaFusion enables:
- Shooting throughout the day
- Editing at camp or in town
- Exporting while charging
- Uploading when connectivity is available
- Maintaining consistent video structure across months

*It removes the dependency on a full laptop-based workflow while preserving professional results.*
