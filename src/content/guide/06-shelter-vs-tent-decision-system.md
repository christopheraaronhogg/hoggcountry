# Shelter Vs. Tent Decision System

## Core Philosophy

- Tent is the default
- Shelters are a safety tool, not a comfort choice
- Poor sleep and mouse exposure are accepted costs only when risk outweighs discomfort
- Decisions are made using objective triggers, not mood or convenience

## When Shelter Becomes the Right Decision

**Go to a shelter if ANY ONE of the following is true:**

### 1. Wind + Cold Combination
- Temps below ~25°F
- Sustained wind 15+ mph or gusts 20+ mph
- Exposed ridge or saddle
- You feel cold before stopping

### 2. Freezing Rain or Heavy Wet Snow
**Automatic shelter night. No debate.**

### 3. Ground Conditions You Cannot Mitigate
- Solid ice
- Snow too deep to anchor
- No flat or drained tent sites

### 4. You Are Wet and Can't Get Dry Before Dark
- Damp clothing
- Temps dropping
- No sun left
- Hands losing dexterity

### 5. Mental or Physical Exhaustion
- Foggy thinking
- Irritation during setup
- Skipping food or water steps

*Shelter reduces complexity when judgment is compromised.*

## What Is NOT a Shelter Trigger

- It's cold but dry and calm
- You're tired but functional
- Others are staying there
- You want convenience

**Tent handles those conditions fine.**

## Winter Decision Framework - Comprehensive

### Georgia vs NC Terrain Comparison (Reality)

**Blood Mountain (Georgia)**
- Shorter but steeper
- Elevation gain is compressed
- Switchbacks exist but are aggressive
- Descent into Neel Gap is harder than the climb
- Punishes pacing mistakes early

**Snowbird / Walnut / Max Patch (NC)**
- Longer, sustained climbs
- Easier to find rhythm
- Weather exposure lasts longer
- More endurance-based suffering

**Bottom line:** Blood Mountain is not taller, but it hits harder sooner. You already handled equal or harder terrain in NC.

## Winter Tent-Site Scoring Checklist

Score each category 0-2. Total possible: 10 points.

**Interpretation:**
- 7-10 → Tent is correct
- 4-6 → Tent only if weather is stable
- 0-3 → Shelter is the smart move

### 1. Wind Protection
- 2: Fully protected, calm
- 1: Partial protection
- 0: Exposed, funneling wind

### 2. Ground Quality
- 2: Flat, drains well, stakes hold
- 1: Minor slope or frozen top layer
- 0: Ice, pooled water, unusable ground

### 3. Moisture Risk
- 2: Dry ground, stable weather
- 1: Damp but manageable
- 0: Freezing rain or heavy wet snow

### 4. Setup Control
- 2: Calm, deliberate setup
- 1: Minor fumbling
- 0: Hands failing, rushing, irritation

### 5. Overnight Confidence

Ask: "Will this still work if conditions worsen at 3 a.m.?"

- 2: Yes, confidently
- 1: Maybe, thin margin
- 0: No, hoping it holds

**Hope is not a winter strategy.**

## One-Minute Decision Prompt

Before committing to camp, ask:

1. Am I dry right now?
2. Is wind increasing or decreasing?
3. Can I pitch cleanly without rushing?
4. Will this setup keep me warm at 3 a.m.?

**If any answer feels shaky, shelter is the correct call.**

## Shelter Night Protocol (When You Go In)

Once shelter is chosen, you switch modes.

### Arrival
- Scan for mice
- Choose sleeping spot away from walls and corners
- Identify food hang or bear box immediately

### Food & Scent Lockdown (FIRST ACTION)

- Food, trash, toothpaste, lip balm, sanitizer, wrappers — all together
- Hang or box immediately
- Nothing scented touches the floor
- Pack stays closed

### Gear Control

**Keep with you:**
- Headlamp
- Phone
- Filter (inside bag)
- Battery bank
- Water bottle

**Never leave loose:**
- Gloves
- Socks
- Trek pole handles
- Hip belt pockets

### Night Behavior

- No food after final hang
- No wrappers opened
- Ignore mice unless contacting gear
- Shoes upright, not flat

### Morning Exit

1. Pack sleep system
2. Pack all non-food gear
3. Retrieve food last
4. Eat outside if possible
5. Visual sweep for crumbs
