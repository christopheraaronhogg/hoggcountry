# Clothing System

## Core Principles

- **Dry at night. Warm while moving. Block wind always.**
- Wet hiking clothes are acceptable.
- Wet + cold + static is dangerous.
- Sleep layers are sacred and never hiked in.
- Calories are heat.

## Layer Definitions

### Base Layer (Next-to-Skin)
- Smartwool merino long-sleeve top
- Smartwool merino long johns
- **Primary role:** Sleep + camp
- **Secondary:** Rare, brief emergency daytime use only

### Active Mid Layer
- Lightweight fleece / grid fleece
- Hiking pants
- **Purpose:** Warmth while moving. Breathable insulation.

### Shell Layer
- Waterproof rain jacket (also wind shell)
- Rain pants
- **Purpose:** Wind and precipitation protection. Critical on ridges and during stops.

### Insulation Layer (Static Only)
- Down puffy jacket
- **Purpose:** Camp warmth. Emergency heat retention. Not used while hiking except in emergencies.

## Layering by Temperature

| Condition | Layers |
|-----------|--------|
| **45-60°F \| Moving / Dry** | Hiking shirt only, pants if windy |
| **35-45°F \| Moving / Dry** | Hiking hoodie, Alpha Freak, hiking pants, Buff optional |
| **25-35°F \| Moving / Dry** | All mid layers, Buff, shell for wind only |
| **20-30°F \| Moving / Snow / Wind** | Full layering including shell, Buff, gloves |
| **Camp / Static (Any Temp)** | Down puffy ON immediately. Shell over puffy if windy. Never rely on Alpha for static warmth. |
| **Sleep (Every Night)** | Smartwool 250 sleep top and pants. Dry socks. Puffy inside quilt if temps drop. |

## 72-Hour Cold/Wet Survival Protocol

### Morning
- Eat something
- Pack sleep clothes first (dry bag)
- Accept wet hiking clothes
- Start slightly cool

### Moving in Rain/Sleet/Snow
- Alpha Freak + shell
- Rain pants
- Vent early to avoid sweat buildup
- Eat every 60-90 minutes
- **Never hike in the down puffy.**

### End-of-Day (Non-Negotiable)
- Strip wet clothes immediately
- Put on dry Smartwool sleep layers
- Puffy on immediately
- Eat calories
- Get into quilt early

### If Forced to Stop (Injury/Delay)
- Puffy on
- Shell on
- Buff + gloves on
- Get off the ground
- Preserve heat first
