## Key Questions for Each Tool

1. **Would a real hiker use this?** Not "could they" but "would they voluntarily open it?"
2. **What decision does it enable?** If you can't name a specific decision, it's probably a gimmick.
3. **Is it better than alternatives?** FarOut, AWOL, AllTrails, weather apps, etc.
4. **Is the interactivity meaningful?** Or is it a static page with extra clicks?
5. **Would they return to it?** Or is it one-and-done?

---

## Red Flags (Gimmick Indicators)

- "This would be cool" instead of "I need this"
- No clear decision output
- Could be replaced by a paragraph of text
- Duplicates FarOut/AWOL functionality without improvement
- User input doesn't meaningfully change output
- Only useful in one very specific edge case
- "Gamification" without real utility (badges, scores, streaks)

---

## Consolidation Candidates

Tools that might be better merged:
- GearCalculator + PackWeightTracker + GearTransitionTracker (all gear-related)
- ResupplyCalculator + TownPlanner + MailDropPlanner (all town/resupply)
- WeatherAssessor + DayLightCalculator + DailyBriefing (all daily conditions)
- MilestoneCalculator + SectionNavigator (both progress tracking)

---

## Evaluation Process

1. Score each tool independently using the 7 criteria
2. Calculate total score
3. Sort by score
4. Apply thresholds to determine action
5. Identify consolidation opportunities
6. Delete gimmicks, merge marginal tools, polish essential tools
