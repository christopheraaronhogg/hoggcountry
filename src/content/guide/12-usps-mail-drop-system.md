- Small/rural offices: Often 7-14 days

### Best Practice

- Ship packages 7-10 days before arrival
- Never ship earlier than 14 days
- Always include an ETA
- If delayed, call the post office

### Box Labeling Format

**Do not deviate from this format:**

```

**Rules:**
- Write your name on all six sides
