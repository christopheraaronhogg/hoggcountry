# Food & Resupply

## Typical Carry Strategy

### Standard Food Carry Range
**3 to 5 days of food** — This is the dominant norm across the entire trail.

### By Section

| Section | Common Carry |
|---------|--------------|
| Early Trail (Georgia through Southern NC) | 3-4 days — Frequent road crossings, hostels close together |
| Mid-Trail and Later | 4-5 days — Rhythm stabilizes |
| Long Carries (6-7+ Days) | Exceptions only. Primarily the 100-Mile Wilderness in Maine. |

## Food Storage & Bear Protection

### The Three Problems

| Threat | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Bears** | Strong, smart, food-conditioned in many AT areas |
| **Mice / Rodents** | Everywhere shelters exist. Silent. Chew gear, not just food. |
| **Humans** | Tired, lazy at night, cut corners. Cause most failures. |

### PCT Bear Hang (Gold Standard)

**Required Geometry (Non-Negotiable)**
- Branch height: 18-20 feet
- Bag height: ~12 feet off ground
- Distance from trunk: ~6 feet
- Distance below branch: ~6 feet

**Step-by-Step**
1. Choose single strong horizontal branch
2. Throw line over branch (use throw bag)
3. Clip food bag to one end with carabiner
4. Hoist bag to proper height
5. Insert stick toggle into carabiner
6. Slowly lower rope until toggle jams
7. Let free end hang loose

**Nothing is tied to the tree.**

### Simple Decision Rule
- Bear box available? → **Use it**
- Bear cables or poles? → **Use them**
- No system + tenting/shelter? → **PCT hang**
- Sleeping in shelter (no bear system)? → **Mouse line + odor control**

## Ramen Cooking Guide

### Trail/Fuel-Saving Method
1. Bring 2-2½ cups water to rolling boil
2. Turn stove OFF
3. Add noodles
4. Cover pot immediately
5. Let sit 5-7 minutes (7-8 minutes below freezing)
6. Add seasoning packet
7. Stir thoroughly
8. Eat immediately

**Key Rule:** Seasoning goes in AFTER soaking, not before.

### Peanut Butter Ramen

> Chicken broth + peanut butter does NOT taste good.

**Best Method: Noodles + Peanut Butter Only**
1. Cook noodles using trail method
2. Drain most water
3. Add 1-2 tablespoons peanut butter
4. Stir until fully coated
5. Optional: Add pinch of seasoning for salt
