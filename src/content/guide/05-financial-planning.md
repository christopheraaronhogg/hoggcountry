### Planning Assumptions

- Total trail time: 242 days
- Start: February 1
- Finish: End of September
- Zero days: One every 5 days (48 total)
- Hiking days: 194

## Cost Model

### Hiking Days (194 days)

| Item | Cost/Day |
|------|----------|
| Trail food + snacks | $22 |

### 💡 Personalizing Your Budget

**This budget reflects specific choices that may not match your preferences.** Your actual costs can vary significantly based on:

**Lodging Strategy:**
- Hostels ($30-50/night) vs. private rooms ($80-150/night)
- Camping/sheltering when possible
- Work-for-stay opportunities
- Impact: Can reduce zero day costs by 50-70%

**Food Approach:**
- Cooking vs. eating out in towns
- Mail drops vs. buying as you go
- Bulk purchasing strategies
- Trail food choices (freeze-dried vs. grocery store)

**Resupply Frequency:**
- Shorter carries = more town stops = higher costs
- Longer carries = fewer zeros = lower costs
- Some hikers zero every 3-4 days, others every 7-10 days

**Personal Comfort Level:**
- Gear replacements and upgrades
- Entertainment, phone usage, luxury items
- Emergency cushion preferences

### Building Your Own Budget

1. Decide your lodging preference (hostel/hotel/camping mix)
2. Estimate your town food spending habits
3. Determine your ideal resupply frequency
4. Add 20-30% buffer for unexpected costs

> *The goal is to fund your hike adequately so that money never becomes the reason your journey is unsafe, rushed, or miserable.*
