# Resupply Logistics


## USPS Mail Drop System

### General Delivery Rules

### Hold Times

- Official USPS rule: Up to 30 days
- Large AT towns: Usually 30 days
- Small/rural offices: Often 7-14 days

### Best Practice

- Ship packages 7-10 days before arrival
- Never ship earlier than 14 days
- Always include an ETA
- If delayed, call the post office

### Box Labeling Format

**Do not deviate from this format:**

```
THEMAN HOGG
GENERAL DELIVERY
CITY, STATE ZIP
PLEASE HOLD FOR AT HIKER
ETA: MM/DD/YYYY
```

**Rules:**
- Write your name on all six sides
- Use Sharpie
- ETA matters
