## Gear Considerations

### The Big Three

| Item | Target Weight (UL) | Comfort Weight | Key Considerations |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Pack | 1-2 lb | 3-5 lb | 50-60L for thru |
| Shelter | 1-2 lb | 3-5 lb | Freestanding easier for AT |
| Sleep System | 2-3 lb | 4-6 lb | 20°F bag for NOBO Feb start |

### Total Pack Weight Targets

| Category | Weight | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Ultralight (base) | <10 lb | Experienced, fair weather |
| Light (base) | 10-15 lb | Most thru-hikers |
| Traditional (base) | 15-20 lb | Comfort-focused |
| Heavy (base) | >20 lb | Over-prepared or inexperienced |

*Base weight = everything except consumables (food, water, fuel)*

### Footwear Reality

- **Trail runners dominant:** 80%+ of thru-hikers use them
- **Boots:** Still used, especially early season
- **Average pairs needed:** 3-5 for full thru
- **Replace every:** 400-600 miles

### Shelter Types on AT

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Tent | Privacy, flexibility | Weight, setup time |
| Tarp | Light, versatile | Requires skill, bugs |
| Hammock | Comfortable, works on slopes | Heavy (with bug net/tarp), limited sites |
| Shelters only | No carry weight | Crowded, mice, snorers, no flexibility |

## Resupply Strategy

### Resupply Frequency

| Method | Frequency | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|

## Safety Considerations

### Wildlife

**Black Bears:**
- Present entire trail, especially VA, PA, NJ
- Food must be hung or in bear canister
- AT shelters have cables or bear boxes
- Never store food in tent
- Make noise on approach

- Wet + wind = danger even at 50°F
- Recognize early signs: shivering, confusion
- Prevention: Stay dry, eat enough, recognize danger

**Lightning:**
- Common above treeline
- Get below treeline if storms approach
- Don't shelter under lone trees
- Drop trekking poles if lightning close

**Heat:**
- Mid-Atlantic summer brutal
- Start early, break midday
- Water needs increase significantly
- Salt supplementation may be needed

### Common Injuries

## Pace & Timing Calculations

### Average Paces (NOBO)

| Phase | Miles/Day | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Week 1-2 | 8-10 | Building trail legs |
| Month 1 | 10-12 | Finding rhythm |
| Month 2-3 | 12-15 | Strong hiking |

| NH/ME | 10-12 | Terrain slows pace |

### Finish Timeline

| Start Date | Expected Finish | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Feb 1 | Mid-August | Comfortable buffer |
| Mar 1 | Early September | Popular timing |
| Mar 15 | Mid-September | Standard timeline |
| Apr 1 | Late September | Tight timing |
| Apr 15 | Early October | Risky for Katahdin |
| May 1 | Late October | Very risky |

### Katahdin Window

- **Closes:** October 15 (hard deadline for thru-hikers)
- **Weather closures:** Common in September-October

## Water & Food

### Water Availability

| Region | Availability | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| GA-NC | Abundant | Multiple sources daily |
| TN-VA | Abundant | Ridge springs |
| PA-NJ | Moderate | Longer carries in PA |
| NY-CT | Moderate | Some dry ridges |
| VT-NH | Abundant | Mountain streams |

| UV (SteriPen) | Fast | Battery, doesn't work in cloudy water |
| Boiling | Kills everything | Fuel use, wait for cooling |

### Calorie Needs

| Activity Level | Calories/Day |
|----------------|--------------|
| Easy day (10 mi) | 3,000-3,500 |
| Moderate (15 mi) | 4,000-4,500 |
| Hard day (20+ mi) | 5,000+ |

**Reality:** Most hikers can't eat enough; expect weight loss

### Food Weight Guidelines

- Target: 1.5-2 lb per day
- Calories/lb: Aim for 125+ cal/oz (nuts, oils, peanut butter)
- Resupply every 3-5 days keeps pack weight manageable

## Red Flags in Trail Content

Watch for these common errors:

1. **Mileage doesn't add up** - Check state totals vs. claimed total
2. **Outdated permit info** - Rules change frequently
3. **Generic gear advice** - AT has specific requirements (rocks, humidity)
4. **No mention of weather variability** - Mt. Washington deaths happen
5. **Over-optimistic pacing** - 20+ miles/day is not sustainable for most
6. **Ignoring mental game** - Virginia Blues, fatigue, isolation
7. **Missing 100-Mile Wilderness prep** - This section requires special planning
8. **Baxter State Park glazed over** - Permit and weather requirements critical
9. **"Just tough it out" mentality** - Smart hikers retreat in bad conditions
10. **No backup plans** - What if Katahdin is closed?
