# Clothing System

## Core Principles

- Dry at night. Warm while moving. Block wind always.
- Wet hiking clothes are acceptable.
- Wet + cold + static is dangerous.
- Sleep layers are sacred and never hiked in.
- Calories are heat.

## Layer Definitions

### Base Layer (Next-to-Skin)
- Smartwool merino long-sleeve top
- Smartwool merino long johns

**Primary role:** Sleep + camp  
**Secondary:** Rare, brief emergency daytime use only

### Active Mid Layer
- Lightweight fleece / grid fleece
- Hiking pants

**Purpose:** Warmth while moving. Breathable insulation.

### Shell Layer
- Waterproof rain jacket (also wind shell)
- Rain pants

**Purpose:** Wind and precipitation protection. Critical on ridges and during stops.

### Insulation Layer (Static Only)
- Down puffy jacket

**Purpose:** Camp warmth. Emergency heat retention. Not used while hiking except in emergencies.

## Layering by Temperature

| Conditions | Layers |
|------------|--------|
| 45-60°F, Moving/Dry | Hiking shirt only, pants if windy |
| 35-45°F, Moving/Dry | Hiking hoodie, Alpha Freak, hiking pants, Buff optional |
| 25-35°F, Moving/Dry | All mid layers, Buff, shell for wind only |
| 20-30°F, Moving/Snow/Wind | Full layering including shell, Buff, gloves |
| Camp/Static (Any Temp) | Down puffy ON immediately, shell over puffy if windy, never rely on Alpha for static warmth |
| Sleep (Every Night) | Smartwool 250 sleep top and pants, dry socks, puffy inside quilt if temps drop |

## 72-Hour Cold/Wet Survival Protocol

### Morning
- Eat something
- Pack sleep clothes first (dry bag)
- Accept wet hiking clothes
- Start slightly cool

### Moving in Rain/Sleet/Snow
- Alpha Freak + shell
- Rain pants
- Vent early to avoid sweat buildup
- Eat every 60-90 minutes

**Never hike in the down puffy.**

### End-of-Day (Non-Negotiable)
- Strip wet clothes immediately
- Put on dry Smartwool sleep layers
- Puffy on immediately
- Eat calories
- Get into quilt early

### If Forced to Stop (Injury/Delay)
- Puffy on
- Shell on
- Buff + gloves on
- Get off the ground
- Preserve heat first

## Cold Weather Clothing System - Comprehensive Details

### Definitive Layer Definitions

These definitions are fixed and used consistently throughout this plan.

#### Base Layer (Next-to-Skin)
- **Base Top:** Smartwool merino long-sleeve
- **Base Bottom:** Smartwool merino long johns
- **Primary role:** sleep + camp
- **Secondary role:** rare, brief emergency daytime use only

**Purpose:** Moisture management, sleep insulation, odor control

#### Active Mid Layer
- **Top:** Lightweight fleece / grid fleece
- **Bottom:** Hiking pants

**Purpose:** Warmth while moving, breathable insulation, primary hiking warmth layer in cold conditions

#### Shell Layer
- **Top:** Waterproof rain jacket (also wind shell)
- **Bottom:** Rain pants

**Purpose:** Wind protection, rain/snow/sleet protection, critical on ridges and during stops

#### Insulation Layer (Static Only)
- Down puffy jacket

**Purpose:** Camp warmth, emergency heat retention, not used while hiking except in emergencies

#### Head & Neck System
- **Beanie:** Smartwool Merino 150 Beanie
- **Neck Gaiter:** Smartwool Thermal Merino Reversible Neck Gaiter
- **Hood Integration:** Shell and puffy jackets both have hoods for additional protection

**Purpose:** Prevent convective heat loss, wind protection on ridges, sleep system efficiency, cold rain and snow protection

#### Hands & Feet (Supporting System)
- Liner gloves
- Waterproof shell mitts
- Wool hiking socks (2 pairs)
- Dedicated dry sleep socks
- Gaiters
- Microspikes (as conditions require)

#### Sleep System (Context)
- High-R-value pad (R-8)
- Cold-weather sleep insulation
- Dry base layers
- Beanie and gaiter used at night as needed

### Core Principles (Non-Negotiable Rules)

1. Start hiking slightly cold
2. Prevent sweat at all costs
3. Adjust early, not late
4. Base bottoms are for sleep and camp (used while hiking only in extreme cold, briefly)
5. Head and neck insulation is critical
6. Cold is acceptable — heat loss is not
7. If wet + cold = slow down or stop early

### Final System Verdict

- All critical layers are present
- Head/neck insulation gap is closed
- Sleep system is protected
- Wind, wet, and cold are all addressed
- No additional clothing is required

**Cold may be felt, but it can always be managed. There is nothing missing that would prevent warmth or safety.**

### Final Confidence Statement

At this point:
- Cold issues would be caused by decisions, not gear
- Sweat management and calorie intake are the main variables
- The system allows recovery from cold, wind, and wet conditions
- This setup is appropriate for early-season Appalachian Trail hiking

**Stop buying gear. This system is complete.**
