# Shelter vs. Tent Decision System

## Core Philosophy

- **Tent is the default**
- Shelters are a safety tool, not a comfort choice
- Poor sleep and mouse exposure are accepted costs only when risk outweighs discomfort
- Decisions are made using objective triggers, not mood or convenience

---

## When Shelter Becomes the Right Decision

Go to a shelter if **ANY ONE** of the following is true:

### Wind + Cold Combination
- Temps below ~25°F
- Sustained wind 15+ mph or gusts 20+ mph
- Exposed ridge or saddle
- You feel cold before stopping

### Freezing Rain or Heavy Wet Snow
**Automatic shelter night. No debate.**

### Ground Conditions You Cannot Mitigate
- Solid ice
- Snow too deep to anchor
- No flat or drained tent sites

### You Are Wet and Can't Get Dry Before Dark
- Damp clothing
- Temps dropping
- No sun left
- Hands losing dexterity

### Mental or Physical Exhaustion
- Foggy thinking
- Irritation during setup
- Skipping food or water steps
- **Shelter reduces complexity when judgment is compromised.**

---

## What Is NOT a Shelter Trigger

- It's cold but dry and calm
- You're tired but functional
- Others are staying there
- You want convenience

**Tent handles those conditions fine.**

## Shelter Night Protocol

### Arrival
- Scan for mice
- Choose sleeping spot away from walls and corners
- Identify food hang or bear box immediately

### Food & Scent Lockdown (First Action)
- Food, trash, toothpaste, lip balm, sanitizer, wrappers — all together
- Hang or box immediately
- Nothing scented touches the floor
- Pack stays closed

### Gear Control

**Keep with you:**
- Headlamp
- Phone
- Filter (inside bag)
- Battery bank
- Water bottle

**Never leave loose:**
- Gloves
- Socks
- Trek pole handles
- Hip belt pockets

### Night Behavior
- No food after final hang
- No wrappers opened
- Ignore mice unless contacting gear
- Shoes upright, not flat

### Morning Exit
- Pack sleep system
- Pack all non-food gear
- Retrieve food last
- Eat outside if possible
- Visual sweep for crumbs
