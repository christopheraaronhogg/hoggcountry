- Clouds dropping into ridges or saddles
- White haze on ridgelines
- Sudden visibility loss
- Fast temperature drop

## Wind Warnings

- Sudden direction change
- Rapid speed increase
- Funneling through gaps/saddles

## 2-Out-of-5 Rule

If **ANY TWO** occur, act conservatively:

1. Pressure dropping (watch elevation drift)
2. Wind increasing or shifting
3. Clouds thickening or lowering
4. Garmin forecast worsens
5. Sudden temperature drop

## Pressure Reading (Stationary Only)

| Elevation Drift | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| ±3-5 ft, settles | Stable |
| Drops 10-20 ft over 3-6 hrs | Weather in 12-24 hrs |
| Drops 20-30+ ft in 1-3 hrs | **Weather imminent** |
