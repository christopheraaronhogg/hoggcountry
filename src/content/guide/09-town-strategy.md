# Town Strategy

## Town Rhythm

### Standard Pattern

- Town stop: Every 3-5 days
- Nero (near-zero day): Every 5-7 days
- Zero day: About every 7-14 days

### Nero Days

Partial day in town:
- Eat
- Shower
- Laundry
- Charge devices
- Resupply
- Then hike short distance (under 10 miles)

### Zero Days

Full 24 hours off trail:
- Complete recovery
- Gear checks
- Physical and mental reset
- Mail drops or gear replacement

## 5-Day Hike + Zero Day Schedule

**Never hike more than 5 days without a zero.**

### Planning Assumptions

- Start window: February 1-7
- Hiking days per cycle: 5
- Zero day per cycle: 1
- Total cycle length: 6 calendar days

### Phase 1: Winter Start (Feb)

**Georgia → Southern NC** | Target: 8-9 miles/hiking day

Cold weather, short daylight, cautious movement. Body-preservation phase.

### Phase 2: Trail Legs Arrive (Mar-May)

**NC/TN → Virginia** | Target: 10-11 miles/hiking day

### Phase 3: Strong & Efficient (May-Jun)

**Virginia** | Target: 12-13 miles/hiking day

Schedule debt gets paid back—without breaking food limits.

### Phase 4: Long Daylight (Jul-Aug)

**NY → VT → NH** | Target: 13-14 miles/hiking day

### Phase 5: Maine Reality (Aug-Sep)

**NH → Katahdin** | Target: 11-12 miles/hiking day

Maine terrain is slower; final push is realistic and safe.

**Expected Finish: September 17-20**

## 🏔️ LATE-TRAIL REALITY CHECK: WHITES → MAINE

**The final 400+ miles (White Mountains → Katahdin) require different planning than the rest of the trail.**

### **White Mountains: AMC Hut System**

**What You Need to Know:**
- **8 AMC huts** along ridgeline (Lakes of the Clouds, Mizpah, Zealand Falls, etc.)
- **NOT shelters** - these are staffed lodges with bunks and meals
- **Reservations:** $150+ per night for bunk + dinner + breakfast
- **Work-for-Stay:** Limited spots (2-4 per hut), arrive early afternoon, crew assigns tasks
- **Strategy:** Don't rely on work-for-stay - have tent as backup
- **Peak Season:** July-August = busiest, hardest to get work-for-stay

**Action:** Research AMC huts before entering Whites. Decide: pay, work-for-stay attempt, or tent/stealth.

---

### **Katahdin Weather: Bail Plan Required**

**Reality:** Katahdin summit attempts can be delayed by weather (wind, rain, lightning).

**The Problem:**
- Baxter State Park rangers WILL turn hikers around in unsafe conditions
- August-September weather can be unpredictable
- You might wait 1-3 days for a summit window

**Your Bail Plan:**
- **Buffer days:** Build 2-3 extra days into your schedule before Katahdin
- **Lodging:** Identify where you'll stay if delayed (Millinocket, Katahdin Stream Campground)
- **Mental prep:** Expect possible delays, don't push finish date promises
- **Weather check:** Monitor Baxter State Park weather forecasts starting 100 miles out

**Action:** Arrive at Katahdin with flexible timeline, not a hard deadline.

---

### **Baxter Permit Process**

**What You Need to Know:**
- **Day-use permits:** Required for Katahdin summit
- **Katahdin Stream Campground:** Popular base for summit attempts
- **Reservation system:** Baxter uses online reservation system
- **2026 Note:** Online reservations open at 6 AM EST (not midnight); extended multi-night booking available
- **Peak season:** August = heavily booked
- **Walk-up permits:** Sometimes available, but not guaranteed

**Action:** Research Baxter permit requirements in August. Book Katahdin Stream Campground or have backup plan.

---

### **100-Mile Wilderness: Food Carry Math**

**The Reality:**
- 100 miles with NO resupply (Mile ~2,093 to ~2,193)
- Most hikers: 7-10 days
- Your pace (11-12 mpd in Maine): ~8-9 days
- **Food weight:** 8-9 days × 1.5 lb/day = **12-14 lb of food**
- Plus full fuel canisters

**Planning:**
- Resupply at Monson, ME (Mile ~2,093)
- Carry 8-9 days of food + 2 fuel canisters
- **White's Crossing optional resupply (Mile ~2,133):** Shaw's Lodging offers food drop-off service (can reduce carry)
- Water is plentiful (lakes, streams)

**Action:** Plan 100-Mile food carry in Monson. Consider White's Crossing resupply if you want to split the carry.

---

### **Mental Game: You're Almost There**

By the time you reach the Whites, you've hiked 1,700+ miles. Fatigue is real.

**Common Late-Trail Mistakes:**
- Rushing to finish (injuries increase)
- Skipping zeros (body is tired)
- Poor weather decisions (summit fever)
- Underestimating final terrain (Whites and Maine are HARD)

**Strategy:**
- Maintain your zero-day schedule (every 5-7 days)
- Respect the terrain (Whites are technical, Maine is slow)
- Don't skip meals or sleep
- Finish strong, not broken

## Laundry System

### Core Reality

You do NOT carry extra clothes. Laundry is done while you are still dressed and functional.

### Standard Laundry Outfit

- Smartwool long johns (bottom)
- Xero Z-Trail sandals (camp shoes)
- Rain jacket (puffy if cold)

### Correct Laundry Order

1. Enter town wearing hiking clothes
2. Change into laundry outfit first
3. Put all hiking clothes directly into washer
4. Add detergent and start washer
5. Shower while washer is running
6. Put laundry outfit back on after shower
7. Transfer clothes to dryer
8. Dry fully (run twice if needed)
9. Change into clean hiking clothes

**Never shower first and then wear dirty clothes again.**

## Walk-Only Resupply: Dollar General

**There are ZERO Walmart stores within 2 walking miles of the AT.** All Walmart resupplies require a ride.
