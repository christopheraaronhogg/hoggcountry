# Power & Electronics


## Battery System

### Dual Battery Setup
- **Anker Nano Power Bank 20K** (20,000 mAh) - 11.0 oz
- **Nitecore NB10000 Gen 3** (10,000 mAh) - 5.3 oz
- **Total Capacity:** 30,000 mAh

### Wall Charger (Towns Only)
- **UGREEN Nexode 65W GaN Charger** (3-port) - 4.5 oz

**Advantage:** Both batteries have built-in USB-C cables. Dual system provides redundancy and 30k mAh total capacity - sufficient for 5-day stretches with Ray-Ban Meta content creation.

## 5-Day Power Budget

**Estimated Total Demand:** ~24,000-26,000 mAh over 5 days  
**Available Capacity:** 30,000 mAh

- 4 days: Comfortable margin (~6k mAh reserve)
- 5 days: Achievable with normal use (~4k mAh reserve)
- 6 days: Requires power discipline

## Daily Charging Routine

### Every Night (Non-Negotiable)
Charge iPhone to ~90-95%

### Every Other Night
Charge Apple Watch Ultra to ~80-90%

### As Needed
- Garmin: charge if below 35%
- Headlamp: charge if below 40%

## Device Priority (Fail-Safe Order)

### NEVER SACRIFICE
1. **iPhone 17 Pro Max** — Navigation, communication, documentation
2. **Garmin inReach Mini 2** — Emergency communication

### LIMIT IF NECESSARY
3. **Apple Watch Ultra** — Time, weather, backup navigation
4. **Nitecore NU25 Headlamp** — Night hiking, camp tasks

### FIRST TO DROP
5. **Ray-Ban Meta Glasses** — Content creation only (non-essential)

## Power-Save Mode

### Trigger Power-Save Mode If:
- Extended cold rain
- No service for 24+ hours
- Battery bank drops below 35%

### Actions:
- iPhone: Low Power Mode ON, brightness <40%, uploads delayed
- Apple Watch: Disable activity tracking
- Garmin Mini: Tracking interval → 30 minutes
- Ray-Ban Glasses: No video unless exceptional

**Result:** Gains approximately **+1 extra trail day**
