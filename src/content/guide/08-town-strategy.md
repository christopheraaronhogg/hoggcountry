# Town Strategy

## Town Rhythm

### Standard Pattern
- Town stop: Every 3-5 days
- Nero (near-zero day): Every 5-7 days
- Zero day: About every 7-14 days

### Nero Days
Partial day in town:
- Eat, Shower, Laundry, Charge devices, Resupply
- Then hike short distance (under 10 miles)

### Zero Days
Full 24 hours off trail:
- Complete recovery
- Gear checks
- Physical and mental reset
- Mail drops or gear replacement

---

## 5-Day Hike + Zero Day Schedule

> **Never hike more than 5 days without a zero.**

### Planning Assumptions
- Start window: February 1-7
- Hiking days per cycle: 5
- Zero day per cycle: 1
- Total cycle length: 6 calendar days

### Phased Mileage Targets

| Phase | Section | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Winter Start (Feb)** | Georgia → Southern NC | 8-9 miles/day — Cold weather, short daylight, cautious movement. Body-preservation phase. |
| **Phase 2: Trail Legs Arrive (Mar-May)** | NC/TN → Virginia | 10-11 miles/day |
| **Phase 3: Strong & Efficient (May-Jun)** | Virginia | 12-13 miles/day — Schedule debt gets paid back—without breaking food limits. |
| **Phase 4: Long Daylight (Jul-Aug)** | NY → VT → NH | 13-14 miles/day |
| **Phase 5: Maine Reality (Aug-Sep)** | NH → Katahdin | 11-12 miles/day — Maine terrain is slower; final push is realistic and safe. |

**Expected Finish: September 17-20**

## Laundry System

### Core Reality
You do NOT carry extra clothes. Laundry is done while you are still dressed and functional.

### Standard Laundry Outfit
- Smartwool long johns (top and/or bottom)
- Flip-flops
- Rain jacket (puffy if cold)

### Correct Laundry Order
1. Enter town wearing hiking clothes
2. Change into laundry outfit first
3. Put all hiking clothes directly into washer
4. Add detergent and start washer
5. Shower while washer is running
6. Put laundry outfit back on after shower
7. Transfer clothes to dryer
8. Dry fully (run twice if needed)
9. Change into clean hiking clothes

**Never shower first and then wear dirty clothes again.**
