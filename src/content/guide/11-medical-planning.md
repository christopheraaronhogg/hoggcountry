## 🏥 INJURY PREVENTION & FIELD TREATMENT
## Common Trail Injuries + How to Avoid Them

### 🦶 **BLISTERS** (Most Common Trail Injury)

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Properly fitted shoes (thumb's width at toe, snug heel)
- ✅ Change socks daily (or twice daily if wet)
- ✅ Air out feet during breaks (remove shoes + socks for 10 min)
- ✅ Trim toenails SHORT before hike (prevents toe blisters)
- ✅ Apply foot powder or BodyGlide to hot spots

**Treatment (Drain vs Leave Intact):**
- **Small blisters (<5mm):** Leave intact, cover with blister bandage (Compeed/moleskin)
- **Large blisters (>5mm):** Drain carefully
  1. Clean with soap/water or sanitizer
  2. Sterilize needle with lighter
  3. Puncture at edge, drain fluid
  4. Leave skin intact (it's natural bandage)
  5. Cover with blister bandage
  6. Change bandage daily, monitor for infection

**When to Take a Zero:**
- Blisters on BOTH heels (can't walk without pain)
- Signs of infection (red, hot, pus, increasing pain)
- Blisters covering >30% of foot surface

### 🦵 **KNEE PAIN** (2nd Most Common)

**Why You Have the Bauerfeind Brace:**
- Provides stability for downhill hiking (where knee injuries happen)
- Hinged design prevents lateral movement
- You already know your knee is vulnerable - respect it

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Use trekking poles (take 25% of impact off knees)
- ✅ Shorten stride on downhills (small steps = less impact)
- ✅ Sidestep steep downhills (switchback even when trail doesn't)
- ✅ Stretch IT band + quads during breaks
- ✅ Wear knee brace on long descents

**When to Take a Nero/Zero:**
- Knee pain that doesn't improve with rest breaks
- Swelling around kneecap
- Pain that changes your gait (you start limping)
- Pain on BOTH knees (overuse signal)

**Red Flag - Bail to Town:**
- Can't bear weight on knee
- Knee buckles or feels unstable
- Severe swelling (knee noticeably larger)

### 🦶 **ACHILLES TENDONITIS / HEEL PAIN**

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Calf stretches every morning before hiking
- ✅ Proper shoe fit (not too tight around heel)
- ✅ Gradual mileage increase (don't jump from 10 → 20 mpd)
- ✅ Address it EARLY (don't "push through")

**Treatment:**
- Ice during town stops (frozen water bottle on heel)
- Ibuprofen (200-400mg, 2-3x daily with food)
- Reduce mileage by 30% for 2-3 days
- Loosen laces around ankle

**When to Zero:**
- Pain that persists after 3 days of reduced mileage
- Pain that worsens during rest (sign of tendon damage)

---

### 🩹 **CUTS, SCRAPES, TRAIL RASH**

**Immediate Field Treatment:**
1. Stop bleeding (pressure + elevation)
2. Clean wound (water + soap if available, or just water)
3. Apply antibiotic ointment if you have it
4. Cover with bandage
5. Change bandage daily

**Watch For Infection:**
- Red streaks extending from wound
- Increased pain after 24 hours
- Pus or bad smell
- Fever or chills

**When to Bail to Town:**
- Signs of infection (above)
- Deep cut that won't stop bleeding
- Cut near joint that limits movement

### 🧊 **HYPOTHERMIA** (Winter-Specific Risk)

**Early Signs (You Can Still Self-Rescue):**
- Shivering
- Cold, pale skin
- Confusion or poor decision-making
- Slurred speech
- Fumbling hands (can't work zippers/buckles)

**Immediate Action:**
- STOP HIKING
- Get out of wind (tent, shelter, behind rock)
- Change into dry clothes
- Get into sleeping bag
- Drink warm liquids (hot water, soup)
- Eat high-calorie food (your body needs fuel to warm up)

**When Shivering Stops = EMERGENCY:**
- This means body is shutting down
- Activate Garmin InReach SOS
- Do NOT let person fall asleep
- Skin-to-skin warming in sleeping bag if with others

**Prevention:**
- Follow GO/NO-GO weather rules
- Change out of wet clothes ASAP
- Eat frequently in cold weather
- Don't push through "I'll warm up when I move"

### 🌟 **NERO vs ZERO: When to Rest**

**NERO (Near-Zero) - Half Day of Hiking:**
- Mild soreness but no specific pain
- Mental fatigue but body feels okay
- Hike 5-8 miles to next shelter/town, then rest

**ZERO (Full Rest Day):**
- Specific injury that needs rest (knee pain, blister, etc.)
- Extreme fatigue (can't get out of sleeping bag)
- Sick (cold, stomach issues, etc.)
- Scheduled town logistics (gear swap, major resupply)

**PUSH THROUGH (Keep Hiking):**
- General soreness (normal for thru-hiking)
- Good spirits, eating well, sleeping well
- No specific pain points
- Weather is favorable

**The Rule:** 
- **Listen to pain, not discomfort.**
- Discomfort is normal. Pain is a warning.
- If you're asking "should I take a zero?" - you probably should.
