We finally made it to Colorado for our Pike's Peak attempt via the classic Barr Trail. Two days planned: up to Barr Camp, then summit day.

## Day 1: Manitou to Barr Camp

- Early start through the Manitou Incline area. Smooth climb through shaded pines.
- Afternoon storms building (classic Rockies). Watched the clouds roll over the ridge.

## Day 2: Summit Push

- Start before sunrise. Long switchbacks, thin air.
- Final push past the A-Frame — tough but rewarding.
