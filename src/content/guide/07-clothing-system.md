# Clothing System


## Core Principles

- Dry at night. Warm while moving. Block wind always.
- Wet hiking clothes are acceptable.
- Wet + cold + static is dangerous.
- Sleep layers are sacred and never hiked in.
- Calories are heat.

## Layer Definitions

### Base Hiking Layer
- **Kuhl Engineered Hoody (long-sleeve sun hoodie)** - 7.0 oz

**Primary role:** Primary hiking shirt for all conditions  
**Secondary:** Sun protection, base layer under Alpha Freak in cold

**Purpose:** Moisture wicking, sun protection, base warmth layer

### Base Layer (Next-to-Skin)
- **Smartwool Merino 250 Sleep Top** - 8.5 oz
- **Smartwool Merino 250 Sleep Pants** - 8.7 oz

**Primary role:** Sleep + camp only  
**Secondary:** Rare, brief emergency daytime use only

**Rule:** Never hike in sleep layers. They stay dry.

### Active Mid Layer
- **Top:** Rab Alpha Freak - Polartec Alpha Direct (12.7 oz)
- **Bottom:** Rab Talus Tights (6.6 oz)

**Purpose:** Warmth while moving, breathable insulation, primary hiking warmth layer in cold conditions

**Purpose:** Wind and precipitation protection. Critical on ridges and during stops.

## Layering by Temperature

### Core Layering Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. Start hiking slightly cold
2. Prevent sweat at all costs
3. Adjust early, not late
4. Base bottoms are for sleep and camp (used while hiking only in extreme cold, briefly)
5. Head and neck insulation is critical
6. Cold is acceptable — heat loss is not
7. If wet + cold = slow down or stop early

### Temperature-Based Layering Guide

| Conditions | Layers |
|------------|--------|
| 60°F+, Moving/Dry | Kuhl Polo (short-sleeve) or sun hoodie, Rab Talus Tights or tights + rain pants if windy |
| 45-60°F, Moving/Dry | Kuhl sun hoodie, Rab Talus Tights or tights + rain pants if windy |
| 35-45°F, Moving/Dry | Kuhl sun hoodie + Rab Alpha Freak, Rab Talus Tights + Rab rain pants, Buff optional |
| 25-35°F, Moving/Dry | Kuhl sun hoodie + Rab Alpha Freak, Rab Talus Tights + Rab rain pants, Buff, OR rain jacket for wind only |
| 20-30°F, Moving/Snow/Wind | Kuhl sun hoodie + Rab Alpha Freak + OR rain jacket, Rab Talus Tights + Rab rain pants, Buff, Rab gloves |
| Camp/Static (Any Temp) | Mountain Hardwear puffy ON immediately, OR rain jacket over puffy if windy, never rely on Alpha Freak for static warmth |
| Sleep (Every Night) | Smartwool 250 sleep top and sleep pants, sleep socks, puffy inside quilt if temps drop |
