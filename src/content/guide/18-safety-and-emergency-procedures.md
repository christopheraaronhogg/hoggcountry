# Safety & Emergency Procedures


## Core Principle

**Act early.** Most trail emergencies are not sudden disasters—they are delayed decisions.

## Rapid Weather Change Recognition

### Visual Warning Signs
- Dark clouds moving quickly, especially low and rolling
- Clouds dropping into ridges or saddles
- White haze forming on ridgelines
- Sudden loss of visibility
- Fast temperature drop over minutes

### Wind-Based Warnings
- Sudden wind direction change
- Rapid increase in wind speed
- Wind funneling hard through gaps or saddles

### Sound & Sensory Warnings
- Any thunder (even distant)
- Metallic or sharp smell in the air
- Tingling, buzzing, or hair standing up

**Lightning protocol immediately. Get off ridges and summits.**

## Hypothermia Indicators

**Shelter or bail immediately if:**

- Wet + cold + wind present
- Hands stop working normally
- Violent shivering OR shivering stops
- Slurred speech or slowed thinking
- Loss of coordination

## Terrain-Based Abort Signals

**Turn around if:**

- Ice on rocks or roots
- Snow covering trail tread
- Fast-rising streams after rain
- Slips increasing in frequency

## Emergency Exit Strategy

### Emergency Call Priority

1. **Call 911 FIRST** — Always the primary emergency number for life, limb, or weather danger
2. National Park Service dispatch: 1-866-677-6677 — For non-emergency follow-up or coordination within NPS lands (Smokies, Shenandoah)
3. If no service: 3 short whistle blasts, repeat

*Note: 911 dispatchers can coordinate with local SAR teams. The NPS number is supplementary, not a replacement for 911.*

### Emergency Location Script

**Use this verbatim when calling:**

```
'I am on the Appalachian Trail.'
'State: [STATE]'
'Nearest named point: [ROAD/SHELTER/LANDMARK]'
'I am hiking northbound.'
'Approximate mile marker: [MILE]'
'GPS coordinates: [LAT/LONG]'
'Can I walk: Yes/No/Limited'
'Nature of problem: [ISSUE]'
```

## InReach Bail-Out Method

### Primary Method: Relay Through Logistics Contact

Message a trusted person at home. They:
- Call hostels
- Call shuttle drivers
- Coordinate rides
- Message instructions back to you

### Example Message

```
'Bad weather. Need off-trail help. I'm near AT mile 725 (McAfee Knob area).'
```

### When to Press SOS

- Injury prevents movement
- Hypothermia risk is real
- Flooding traps you
- You are lost and disoriented
- Self-rescue is no longer possible

## 📡 EMERGENCY CONTACT PROTOCOL: Using Your Garmin InReach Effectively

### **DAILY CHECK-IN SYSTEM**

**Your Home Contact:** 
- Name: ______________________
- Phone: ______________________
- Email: ______________________

**Daily Protocol:**
- ✅ Send check-in message by 7 PM every day (even if brief)
- ✅ Include: Location (shelter name or mile marker), status (good/tired/sore), plan for next day
- ✅ Example: "Mile 327, Hot Springs tonight, all good, headed to Damascus next"

**If You Miss Check-In:**
- Home contact waits until 9 PM
- If no message by 9 PM, you send: "Delayed but safe, checking in tomorrow"
- If NO contact for 24 hours → home contact calls local ranger station

---

### 🚨 **SOS BUTTON: When to Press It**

**PRESS SOS FOR:**
- ❌ Life-threatening injury (can't move, severe bleeding, head trauma)
- ❌ Medical emergency (chest pain, severe allergic reaction, hypothermia)
- ❌ Immobilized (broken bone, can't walk)
- ❌ Lost + no way to navigate (rare with GPS, but possible in whiteout)

**DO NOT PRESS SOS FOR:**
- ✅ Blisters, sore muscles, fatigue
- ✅ Running low on food (you can always bail to a road)
- ✅ Bad weather (unless GO/NO-GO says bail)
- ✅ Feeling lonely or scared (use regular messaging)

**What Happens When You Press SOS:**
- GEOS (rescue coordination) receives alert with your GPS coordinates
- They contact you via InReach to assess situation
- They dispatch rescue (helicopter, ranger, SAR team) if needed
- **Cost:** Rescue can cost $10,000+ if not life-threatening

**Before Pressing SOS, Ask:**
1. Can I self-rescue? (hike out, treat injury myself)
2. Can I contact a friend/shuttle for pickup?
3. Is this TRULY life-threatening?

---

### 💬 **MESSAGING PROTOCOL**

**Types of Messages:**

**1. Daily Check-In (Every Day by 7 PM):**
- "Mile 327, Hot Springs, all good"
- "Neels Gap, taking zero, knee sore but okay"

**2. Itinerary Update (When Plans Change):**
- "Staying extra day in Damascus for gear swap"
- "Skipping Franklin, heading straight to Hot Springs"

**3. Weather Delay:**
- "Bailing to shelter, wind too high for ridge"
- "Zero day due to ice storm, safe in town"

**4. Injury/Issue (Non-Emergency):**
- "Knee pain, taking nero tomorrow, will update"
- "Blisters, hiking slow, still on track"

**5. Emergency (Before SOS):**
- "Injured but stable, need shuttle pickup at [road crossing]"
- "Sick, hiking out to nearest town, will call"

---

### 📞 **ESCALATION PLAN**

**Level 1: You're In Control**
- Minor issue (blister, fatigue, weather delay)
- You message home contact with update
- You continue hiking or take nero/zero
- Home contact does nothing unless you ask

**Level 2: You Need Help But Not Rescue**
- Injury that requires town visit (bad blister, knee pain)
- You message home contact: "Need shuttle pickup at [location]"
- Home contact arranges shuttle or advises on options
- You hike to pickup point

**Level 3: You Need Rescue**
- Can't move, severe injury, medical emergency
- You press SOS button
- GEOS coordinates rescue
- You message home contact: "Pressed SOS, [brief description]"
- Home contact monitors situation, stays in touch with GEOS

---

### 📋 **PRE-TRAIL PREP WITH HOME CONTACT**

**Before You Leave, Your Home Contact Needs:**

1. ✅ **Copy of this guide** (so they understand your plan)
2. ✅ **Your Garmin InReach login** (so they can see your tracking map)
3. ✅ **Ranger station phone numbers** (from Field Quick-Reference Card)
4. ✅ **Your insurance info** (health insurance card photo)
5. ✅ **Emergency contact protocol** (this section)

**Have a Conversation:**
- "If I miss a check-in, wait until 9 PM, then try messaging me."
- "If 24 hours with no contact, call [ranger station for my last known location]."
- "If I press SOS, GEOS will contact you. Stay calm, follow their instructions."
- "I'll check in every day by 7 PM. If I'm delayed, I'll say why."

---

### 🗺️ **BACKUP NAVIGATION PLAN**

**Primary:** Garmin inReach Mini 2 (GPS + messaging)

**If Garmin Fails:**
- ✅ Download FarOut maps offline (on iPhone)
- ✅ White blazes (follow the trail)
- ✅ AT shelter signs (show mileage to next shelter)
- ✅ Ask other hikers
- ✅ Worst case: hike to nearest road, flag down car, ask for ride to town

**You Won't Get Lost:**
- AT is one of the most well-marked trails in the world
- White blazes every 50-100 feet
- Shelters every 8-15 miles
- Other hikers (NOBO bubble) will be nearby

**But If You DO Get Disoriented:**
1. STOP. Don't keep walking.
2. Look for white blazes (2.5" × 6" white rectangles)
3. Check your last known location on Garmin
4. Backtrack to last shelter or landmark
5. Message home contact: "Disoriented but safe, backtracking"
