# Layering Chart

## While Moving

| Temp | Layers |
|------|--------|
| **45-60°F** | Hiking shirt only, pants if windy |
| **35-45°F** | Hiking hoodie, Alpha Freak, hiking pants, Buff optional |
| **25-35°F** | All mid layers, Buff, shell for wind only |
| **20-30°F** | Full layering including shell, Buff, gloves |

## Static / Camp

- **Down puffy ON immediately**
- Shell over puffy if windy
- Never rely on Alpha for static warmth

## Sleep (Every Night)

- Smartwool 250 sleep top and pants
- Dry socks
- Puffy inside quilt if temps drop

## Core Rules

- **Wet hiking clothes = acceptable**
- **Wet + cold + static = dangerous**
- **Sleep layers are sacred — never hike in them**
- **Calories are heat**
