# Trail Sections & Milestones


## Town Rhythm

### Standard Pattern

- Town stop: Every 3-5 days
- Nero (near-zero day): Every 5-7 days
- Zero day: About every 7-14 days

### Nero Days

Partial day in town:
- Eat
- Shower
- Laundry
- Charge devices
- Resupply
- Then hike short distance (under 10 miles)

### Zero Days

Full 24 hours off trail:
- Complete recovery
- Gear checks
- Physical and mental reset
- Mail drops or gear replacement

## 5-Day Hike + Zero Day Schedule

**Never hike more than 5 days without a zero.**

### Planning Assumptions

- Start window: February 1-7
- Hiking days per cycle: 5
- Zero day per cycle: 1
- Total cycle length: 6 calendar days

### Phase 1: Winter Start (Feb)

**Georgia → Southern NC** | Target: 8-9 miles/hiking day

Cold weather, short daylight, cautious movement. Body-preservation phase.

### Phase 2: Trail Legs Arrive (Mar-May)

**NC/TN → Virginia** | Target: 10-11 miles/hiking day

### Phase 3: Strong & Efficient (May-Jun)

**Virginia** | Target: 12-13 miles/hiking day

Schedule debt gets paid back—without breaking food limits.

### Phase 4: Long Daylight (Jul-Aug)

**NY → VT → NH** | Target: 13-14 miles/hiking day

### Phase 5: Maine Reality (Aug-Sep)

**NH → Katahdin** | Target: 11-12 miles/hiking day

Maine terrain is slower; final push is realistic and safe.

**Expected Finish: September 17-20**

## 🏔️ LATE-TRAIL REALITY CHECK: WHITES → MAINE

**The final 400+ miles (White Mountains → Katahdin) require different planning than the rest of the trail.**

### **White Mountains: AMC Hut System**

**What You Need to Know:**
- **8 AMC huts** along ridgeline (Lakes of the Clouds, Mizpah, Zealand Falls, etc.)
- **NOT shelters** - these are staffed lodges with bunks and meals
- **Reservations:** $150+ per night for bunk + dinner + breakfast
- **Work-for-Stay:** Limited spots (2-4 per hut), arrive early afternoon, crew assigns tasks
- **Strategy:** Don't rely on work-for-stay - have tent as backup
- **Peak Season:** July-August = busiest, hardest to get work-for-stay

**Action:** Research AMC huts before entering Whites. Decide: pay, work-for-stay attempt, or tent/stealth.

### **Katahdin Weather: Bail Plan Required**

**Reality:** Katahdin summit attempts can be delayed by weather (wind, rain, lightning).

**The Problem:**
- Baxter State Park rangers WILL turn hikers around in unsafe conditions
- August-September weather can be unpredictable
- You might wait 1-3 days for a summit window

**Your Bail Plan:**
- **Buffer days:** Build 2-3 extra days into your schedule before Katahdin
- **Lodging:** Identify where you'll stay if delayed (Millinocket, Katahdin Stream Campground)
- **Mental prep:** Expect possible delays, don't push finish date promises
- **Weather check:** Monitor Baxter State Park weather forecasts starting 100 miles out

**Action:** Arrive at Katahdin with flexible timeline, not a hard deadline. See Part IV for Baxter permit requirements.

### **100-Mile Wilderness: Food Carry Math**

**The Reality:**
- 100 miles with NO resupply (Mile ~2,093 to ~2,193)
- Most hikers: 7-10 days
- Your pace (11-12 mpd in Maine): ~8-9 days
- **Food weight:** 8-9 days × 1.5 lb/day = **12-14 lb of food**
- Plus full fuel canisters

**Planning:**
- Resupply at Monson, ME (Mile ~2,093)
- Carry 8-9 days of food + 2 fuel canisters
- **White's Crossing optional resupply (Mile ~2,133):** Shaw's Lodging offers food drop-off service (can reduce carry)
- Water is plentiful (lakes, streams)

**Action:** Plan 100-Mile food carry in Monson. Consider White's Crossing resupply if you want to split the carry.

### **Mental Game: You're Almost There**

By the time you reach the Whites, you've hiked 1,700+ miles. Fatigue is real.

**Common Late-Trail Mistakes:**
- Rushing to finish (injuries increase)
- Skipping zeros (body is tired)
- Poor weather decisions (summit fever)
- Underestimating final terrain (Whites and Maine are HARD)

**Strategy:**
- Maintain your zero-day schedule (every 5-7 days)
- Respect the terrain (Whites are technical, Maine is slow)
- Don't skip meals or sleep
- Finish strong, not broken
