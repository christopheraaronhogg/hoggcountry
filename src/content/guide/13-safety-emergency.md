# Safety & Emergency Procedures

## Core Principle

**Act early.** Most trail emergencies are not sudden disasters—they are delayed decisions.

---

## Rapid Weather Change Recognition

### Visual Warning Signs
- Dark clouds moving quickly, especially low and rolling
- Clouds dropping into ridges or saddles
- White haze forming on ridgelines
- Sudden loss of visibility
- Fast temperature drop over minutes

### Wind-Based Warnings
- Sudden wind direction change
- Rapid increase in wind speed
- Wind funneling hard through gaps or saddles

### Sound & Sensory Warnings
- Any thunder (even distant)
- Metallic or sharp smell in the air
- Tingling, buzzing, or hair standing up

**Lightning protocol immediately. Get off ridges and summits.**

---

## Hypothermia Indicators

**Shelter or bail immediately if:**

- Wet + cold + wind present
- Hands stop working normally
- Violent shivering OR shivering stops
- Slurred speech or slowed thinking
- Loss of coordination

---

## Terrain-Based Abort Signals

**Turn around if:**

- Ice on rocks or roots
- Snow covering trail tread
- Fast-rising streams after rain
- Slips increasing in frequency

---

## Emergency Exit Strategy

### Emergency Call Priority

1. **Call 911 FIRST** — Always the primary emergency number for life, limb, or weather danger
2. National Park Service dispatch: 1-866-677-6677 — For non-emergency follow-up or coordination within NPS lands (Smokies, Shenandoah)
3. If no service: 3 short whistle blasts, repeat

*Note: 911 dispatchers can coordinate with local SAR teams. The NPS number is supplementary, not a replacement for 911.*

### Emergency Location Script

**Use this verbatim when calling:**

```
"I am on the Appalachian Trail."
"State: [STATE]"
"Nearest named point: [ROAD/SHELTER/LANDMARK]"
"I am hiking northbound."
"Approximate mile marker: [MILE]"
"GPS coordinates: [LAT/LONG]"
"Can I walk: Yes/No/Limited"
"Nature of problem: [ISSUE]"
```

## InReach Bail-Out Method

### Primary Method: Relay Through Logistics Contact

Message a trusted person at home. They:
- Call hostels
- Call shuttle drivers
- Coordinate rides
- Message instructions back to you

### Example Message

```
"Bad weather. Need off-trail help. I'm near AT mile 725 (McAfee Knob area)."
```

### When to Press SOS

- Injury prevents movement
- Hypothermia risk is real
- Flooding traps you
- You are lost and disoriented
- Self-rescue is no longer possible
