# Hiker Profile & Experience


## Hiking Resume

This section documents verified long-distance completions, prior AT experience, and the skills that directly translate to Appalachian Trail readiness.

### Completed Thru-Hikes

| Trail | Distance | Elevation Gain | Location |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Ouachita Trail | ~223 miles | ~45,000 ft | Arkansas-Oklahoma |
| Ozark Highlands Trail | ~270 miles | ~35,000-40,000 ft | Northern Arkansas |
| Ozark Trail | ~230 miles | ~40,000 ft | Missouri |

**Total Completed Mileage:** ~720+ miles  
**Estimated Cumulative Elevation Gain:** ~120,000+ feet

### Recognition

**Sassafras Award — Ozark Society**  
Awarded for completion of the Ouachita Trail, Ozark Highlands Trail, and Ozark Trail. *6th person in history to receive this award.*

### Prior Appalachian Trail Experience

- **Standing Bear Farm to Hot Springs, NC** — ~35 miles | ~9,000 ft elevation gain | Full pack, winter conditions
- **Newfound Gap to Kuwohi (Overnight)** — ~16 miles round trip | ~3,300 ft elevation gain | Shelter stay in ~17°F conditions | Summit: 6,643 ft (highest point on the AT)

*Note: Clingmans Dome was officially renamed to "Kuwohi" in 2024, restoring its Cherokee name meaning "mulberry place."*

### High-Elevation Experience (Comparison Benchmark)

**Pikes Peak, Colorado — Crags Trail**  
~13 miles round trip | ~4,300 ft elevation gain | Summit elevation: 14,115 ft

*Note: Pikes Peak is located in Colorado, not on the Appalachian Trail. This entry is included as a cardiovascular and altitude benchmark demonstrating capability for AT climbs.*

### Core Competencies

- Multi-week self-supported backpacking
- Cold-weather camping and shelter living
- Sustained elevation gain/loss over long distances
- Rugged, rocky, under-maintained trail systems
- River crossings and navigation
- Resupply planning and execution
- Proven physical and mental endurance

## Mountain Climb Readiness & Assessment

### AT Miles Completed to Date

| Section | Distance | Conditions | Key Features |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Standing Bear Farm → Hot Springs, NC | ~33 miles | Winter, ~35 lb pack | Snowbird Mountain, High difficulty |
| Newfound Gap ↔ Kuwohi | ~15.6 miles RT | ~17°F, winter Smokies | Entirely high-altitude AT miles |

**TOTAL AT MILES HIKED: ~49 miles** ✅

*These are hard miles, not summer or low-grade terrain.*

### Experience Benchmark: Pikes Peak (Colorado)

**Crags Trail → Summit**
- Start elevation: ~10,000 ft
- Summit: 14,115 ft
- Net gain: ~4,100 ft
- Distance: ~6.5 miles

**What This Proves:**
- You've already matched Katahdin-level vertical
- You started higher than any AT climb
- Cardiovascularly, the AT holds no surprises

*Note: This benchmark is for fitness comparison only—Pikes Peak is not on the Appalachian Trail.*

### What Your 49 AT Miles Mean

- You are ahead of the average NOBO at Springer
- Georgia and NC will not shock you
- Virginia will annoy you, not break you
- Whites and Maine demand respect, not fear

*Most hikers learn these lessons in the first 200 miles. You already own them.*

### Readiness Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Physical Readiness | 9/10 | Long climbs proven, cold conditions proven |
| Mental Readiness | 10/10 | You've already hiked when it sucked, you know when to back off |
| Logistics Readiness | 8.5/10 | Trail rhythm still develops on-trail |
| **OVERALL NOBO READINESS** | **9/10** | |
